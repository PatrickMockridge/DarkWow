//! Generic contract client trait — the interface between the wallet's
//! capability kernel and each contract's ZK proof builders.
//!
//! Each contract implements this trait in its own crate
//! (`src/contract/<name>/src/client/`). The wallet dispatches generically
//! through this trait — no per-contract logic in the wallet.
//!
//! Architecture:
//!   Wallet → ContractClient::build(function, params) → (call_data, proofs)
//!   The contract's client loads its ZK binary, builds witnesses from
//!   wallet state, generates the proof, and encodes parameters.
//!   The wallet only attaches the fee and broadcasts the transaction.

/// Interface for contract function builders.
/// Each contract implements this in its own crate.
pub trait ContractClient {
    /// Build call data and ZK proofs for a contract function.
    ///
    /// - `function`: function name (e.g., "create_escrow", "TransferV1")
    /// - `params`: JSON-encoded parameters for the function
    ///
    /// Returns Ok((call_data, proof_bytes)) where call_data is the serialized
    /// function parameters (NOT including the function code byte).
    /// proof_bytes are raw ZK proof byte vectors.
